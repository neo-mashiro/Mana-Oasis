4D reconstruction of my imaginary world...

This project aims to build an exploration RPG game that provides players with immersive experience, targeted at high-end PCs and VR platforms. The expected release date is Sep, 2022. (I'll publish it on Steam when the time comes)

The introduction website will be published from the `gh-pages` branch. (in construction)
