  \section{Game Overview}
    \subsection{What is the game? (philosophy)}
      Describe the game is a paragraph. This is the answer to the most common question that you will be asked. What are you working on?
      discovery + fantasy + challenge(how?) adventure game that is narratively driven by various ACG artworks? virtual tourism, virtual construction, 3D Chat World, explore secrets?

      set up goals and challenges for the player. 哲学启发式引导，用情感和文字的力量去引人入胜，后期音乐想办法问版权。可以阅读书籍的世界。故事主线为哲学思考和寻宝，找到世界的秘密，有各种提示和任务。

    \subsection{Why create this game?}
      Why are you creating this game? Do you love 3D shooters? Do you think there is a hole in the market for Jell-O tossing midgets?
      incorporate what you wrote as your dream list on Zhihu.com

    \subsection{Where does the game take place?}
      Describe the world that your game takes place in. Simple as that. Help frame it in the reader’s mind by spending a few sentences on it here. You can go into lengthy detail later in a section solely dedicated to describing the world. Remember that we want to keep this part of the design light and readable.

    \subsection{What do I control?}
      Describe what the player will control. You will be in charge of a band of rabid mutant fiddle players. If you want you can switch on the AI and turn it into a fish bowl simulation.

    \subsection{What is the main focus?}
      Now that we know where the game takes place and what the player controls. What are they supposed to achieve in this world? Angry fiddle players take over the U.N. building. Be careful not to add a bunch of salesmanship here. Your design wants to stay light and informative.

    \subsection{What’s different?}
      Tell them what is different from the games that are attempting this in the market right now. This question comes up a lot. How is this game unique? What differentiates it from other games?

%   ------------------- best practices -----------------------
% assets that do not move at runtime (wall, buildings, etc.) must be set to STATIC status!!!
% Import third-party assets in a clean manner
% Document your setup (Tag uses, Layer uses, etc.)
% Put all your code in a namespace to avoid conflicts
% If you have a lot of text, put it in a file. (storytelling)
% Use property drawers to make fields more user-friendly.
% Separate interface from game logic.
% Use state machines to get different behavior in different states
% make the project structure clean and neat, separate modules (main scripts)
% input controller, player controller, game state manager(menu, inplay, quit, pause...), skill tree system, quest system...
% optimize performance

%   ------------------- bonus -----------------------
% how to utilize the power of AI and machine learning in your game?
% customize the splash screen with my own game logo and title + visual effects (don't wait until your Pro subscription expires in 2021.September)
